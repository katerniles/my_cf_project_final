        <p>To answer that question, let's ask a few more:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Do you have a product, service, or message you want to offer others?</li>
          <li>Are you too successful without a site that you can afford to turn away business</li></ul>
        <p>If the answer to these are yes and no, respectively, then you probably need a website that will help you:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>communicate with others, telling your story and letting others know about your and your offerings.</li>
          <li>build a following or community.</li>
          <li>become more successful in your efforts at a relatively low cost and reaching more people than you could through any other medium.</li></ul>

        <p>I'm big on usability and accessibility, and you'll hear me rant and rave about how your site needs to be both.</p>
        <p>Think of it this way. What good is your investment (and yes, it is an investment) in your website if you simply irritate visitors by not making it as usable as possible? Would you purposely build walls where doors should be in your office or store? Would you put up gates deterring shoppers or clients?</p>
        <p>Ensuring a usable site will pay off by allowing visitors to accomplish their goals--their reason for coming to your site--and help you accomplish your goals in building the site. It's a win-win situation!</p>

          Will I make money off my site?

    <div id="collapsethree" class="panel-collapse collapse in" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="headingthree">
      <div class="panel-body">
        <p>That depends on a lot of things.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Is your site written in such a way that visitors want to purchase your services or goods?</li>
          <li>Is it easy for visitors to make a purchase or contact you to arrange for services?</li>
          <li>Is your site more attractive, easier to use, or offering something unique to attract buyers?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Making sure your content is written for the right audience, optimized for web (it's a different language and style than print), and that your offerings are clear and enticing will go a long way toward paying for your investment and more.</p>

        <p>Unlike print, websites are living, (almost) breathing things. They have to be fed.</p>
        <p>How often have you seen a site that has old news, outdated facts, or even (gasp!) incorrect pricing or other information? It's a real turnoff, isn't it?</p>
        <p>As much as we like to prepare something once and then forget it, your website is not a crockpot. You will need to stir, adjust the heat, and even add spices occasionally to keep it up-to-date and interesting, especially to those visitors who return (and they will!).</p>

        <p>Ever hear of Twitter? Facebook?</p>
        <p>Both of those are free to set up and can help you reach audiences you may not have even known you had!</p>
        <p>Yes, they take a bit of time. But as you're reaching for your morning coffee, or returning from a meeting mid-afternoon, you can send off a quick Tweet sharing some information, views, or offerings in just 140 characters. And as you retire for the evening, why not post a picture of someone using your product, or a testimonial from a valued client?</p>
        <p>A little practice, a little research, and a little time are all that's needed to reach even more folks who are interested in what you offer or who might be interested, if you just reach out to them!<p>
